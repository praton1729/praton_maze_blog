Hi there,

I am Prathu Baronia and I am a kernel engineer currently working at OnePlus R&D,
Hyderabad, India.

I blog about things that I learn during my experiments with the linux kernel on
Qualcomm's SDM845, SM8150, SM8250 platforms which are based on arm64
architecture.  I also work on x86_64 occasionally as per need of the situation.

I try to blog about concepts which I found or still find hard to understand
since that might help other people and this also serves as a place where I can
document my kernel journey.

This blog contains concepts related to the Driver and Memory subsystem of the
kernel for most part, but occasionally other subsystems might feature in.

I also talk about efficient work setups and productivity tools developed by me
or someone else which I find useful.
