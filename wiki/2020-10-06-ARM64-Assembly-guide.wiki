== Calling convention ==

The 64-bit ARM (AArch64) calling convention allocates the 31 general-purpose registers as:

<pre>x31 (SP): Stack pointer or a zero register, depending on context.
x30 (LR): Procedure link register, used to return from subroutines.
x29 (FP): Frame pointer.
x19 to x29: Callee-saved.
x18 (PR): Platform register. Used for some operating-system-specific special
purpose, or an additional caller-saved register.
x16 (IP0) and x17 (IP1): Intra-Procedure-call scratch registers.
x9 to x15: Local variables, caller saved.
x8 (XR): Indirect return value address.
x0 to x7: Argument values passed to and results returned from a subroutine.</pre>
All registers starting with x have a corresponding 32-bit register prefixed with w. Thus, a 32-bit x0 is called w0.
