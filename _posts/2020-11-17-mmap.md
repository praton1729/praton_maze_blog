Deep diving into mmap and trying to profile the malloc timings with custom
benchmarking programs.

# What is fucking mmap?

mmap is a system call that maps file/device or a memory region in a process's
address space.  It is a method of memory-mapped file I/O. It implements demand
paging, because file contents are not read from disk directly and initially do
not use physical RAM at all.

## Some info on malloc:-
- Malloc might call brk/sbrk or mmap based on the implementation and the size of
  the allocation.
- brk/sbrk system calls adjust the size of the heap by moving the process's
  program break as shown below.

- If ASLR is turned off then there is no gap between the end of the
  uninitialized data and start of the heap
- If ASLR is turned on then there is a random offset placed between them as
  shown below.
- As show below the mmap section is placed between stack and heap.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using mmap?

- Sharing memory within parents and children processes. 

## Difference between anonymous memory through malloc and mmap?

On some systems using private anonymous mmaps is more efficient than
using malloc for large blocks. This is not an issue with the GNU C Library, as
the included malloc automatically uses mmap where appropriate.

## Test code

{% include code/mmap/mmap_anonymous_allocation.c %}

## Conclusions

Test code suggests (for x86_64 right now):-
- As the allocation size for anonymous memory increases the allocation and
  zeroing timing for malloc can shoot up and vary a lot but  for mmap there is
not much variation(can be supported by data). 
- Since malloc will not really allocate the pages unless they are written to  so
  we need to write 0 to them explicitly.
- For mmap, when we map a file the data is not fetched until we start editing it
  i.e. demand paging. 
	- In case of the anonymous memory allocation the data is initialized as
	  zero.
- Using mmap in place of malloc makes the code less portable.

### Tips:
- The syscalls called by malloc can be checked by running the program with
  strace.
